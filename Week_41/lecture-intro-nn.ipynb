    "## Optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important optimizers to know are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SGD including minor variations (specifically momentum and to a lesser degree weight decay and Nesterov  acceleration). Sometimes a bit difficult to \"get right\".\n",
    "1. Adam is the best \"out-of-the-box\" tool. Tends to work well, converge fast, and not require a lot of tuning. \n",
    "1. Adagrad is an optimizer that seeks to perform bigger updates for parameters that rarely gets updated, which in some settings is beneficial. \n",
    "1. Adadelta is a more \"robust\" version of Adagrad, which considers a \"window\" of sum of squares rather than the entire sequence. \n",
    "1. RMSProp is similar in spirit to Adadelta, in that it keeps track of a running average of squared gradients which it uses to normalize its updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The (or my) \"rule of thumb\": Use Adam. For best performance (at least in the field I am most familiar with), SGD (*with momentum*) tends to come out on top but is slightly more difficult to use than Adam. Hence, start with Adam, and maybe consider switching to SGD to squeeze out that little extra performance of your model. See https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers for an overview and for the optimizers' parameters."

    "\n",
    "The most classical example to code in deep learning - the so-called \"Hello World\" of deep learning - is classification of images of digits: The MNIST dataset. This is very similar to the digits example from our first lecture, but the images are larger and we have more of them. So let's try to see what we can do!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the $\\texttt{mnist}$ dataset (as just shown in the slides). Build a neural network using what we have explored so far and evaluate its performance on the test data.\n",
    "1. Explore whether your neural network appears to be under- or overfitting by constructing plots of the train and test losses and accuracies during training. Use this information to improve your model - that is, train for longer if it appears to be underfitting and shorter if it appears to be overfitting. Does your test performance improve? What about your train performance?\n",
    "1. (Bonus): Later during the semester, we will explore *convolutional neural networks*. For those of you finished with (1) and (2), you may try this now to improve your model; check https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You may use the notebook I have uploaded under this lecture as a starting point ($\\texttt{exercise-nn-mnist.ipynb}$). It provides some of the code, and you then have to fill in the rest. You do not have to use it - it is there if you think it might be helpful!"

    "1. Use appropriate data, including needed transformations (such as scaling).\n",
    "1. Use appropriate *architecture*, such as knowing when to use fully connected layers (what we have done today) and when to deviate (a focus of future lectures). Also some trivial choices are here, i.e. use \"good\" activation functions, output functions, etc., but it also includes considering the optimal width and depth of your network, which is not trivial.\n",
    "1. A proper loss function. In practice this is very easy - use cross entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression.\n",
    "1. Use a good optimzier and an appropriate learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. In practice: Adam with default settings, maybe tuning the learning rate and/or batch size, and keeping track of validation loss while training to know when to stop.\n",
    "1. Make sure to balance bias and variance so as to neither under- nor overfit. How to do this? Something we will discuss in more detail later."

    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider last exercise (i.e. the MNIST data). Suppose you are restricted to **training for only 2 epochs** but still want a good model. You recognize that finding the right learning rate is going to be very important. For this reason, you split your training data into a train and a validation set and use the validation set to find the optimal learning rate. Train a model with you optimized learning rate and evaluate it on your test data.\n",
    "1. Recognizing that the batch size is also important for training speed, you decide to extend your above analysis to also find the optimal batch size. Once again, train a model with you optimized learning rate *and* batch size and evaluate it on your test data.\n",
    "1. You have heard that momentum is important. You know that many optimizers already incorporate momentum by default, but you are now forced by your evil teacher to use SGD and otherwise repeat (1) and (2). You decide to extend your above analysis to also find the optimal momentum for SGD (see https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD for how to set it). Once again, train a model with you optimized learning rate, batch size, *and* momentum and evaluate it on your test data.\n",

Reload it (with a new name) and perform evaluation again (to check it is the same). Train the reloaded model for 2 epochs. Evaluate. See how its performance is better now - this is since it has trained for 4 total epochs now.\n",
