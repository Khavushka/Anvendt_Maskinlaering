    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "*Recurrent neural networks* (RNNs) are a type of neural network used to handle/analyze *sequential* data, i.e. data where the next data point is somehow related to the prior data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the case in many applications, including forecasting sales, analyzing text, working with videos, and interacting with dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are a *special case* of feed forward neural networks - just as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are. And just as CNNs allowed us to more easily work with grids of values (such as images), RNNs more easily allow us to work with sequences of values (such as time series or text).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will learn how to use RNNs to solve tasks of modelling sequences. Today, we will learn the fundamentals of RNNs, including showcasing how they can be used to solve regression and classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week, we will use an RNN to generate text. In particular, we will use the works of Shakespeare in order to train a neural network that can act as a playwriter - in the style of Shakespeare! In order to write meaningful text, we must know what is already written! Hence, we exploit the recurrent/sequential structure of the data in order to create meaningful text."

    "\n",
    "An RNN is a type of network that for each input outputs both the standard output we are familiar with, as well as a \"state\" that is passed on as part of the input for the next period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the network makes a prediction - as we are used to - and *summarizes the information needed to be passed on*. In this way, the next prediction the network makes (can) use this information as part of its input.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, an RNN is a type of network with a \"loop\", in that it feeds into itself. This loop is sometimes called the \"recurrent connection\"."

This may seem counterintuitive, and in time-series forecasting it certainly often does not make sense, but think of understanding a movie review.

    "\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "1. RNNs are a type of model that allows the learning of long-term dependencies by making efficient use of parameter sharing.\n",
    "1. Although not directly related to RNNs, embedding layers are a powerful tool to map sparse data (such as one-hot encoded words) to dense matrices. Combining embedding layers with RNNs allows for powerful language models.\n",
    "1. RNNs may be used to perform sequence prediction, including using them in an \"autoregressive\" way (using their output as a new input), which allows for generative modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "1. RNNs are notoriously difficult and slow to train, since the loop has to be unfolded for backpropagation. This results in extremely deep models for long sequences.\n",
    "1. This had led to research in e.g. NLP to focus on non-RNN models, such as the transformer."

    "## Summary and looking ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "In these lecture, we dived deep into the world of NLP and more generally working with sequential data, covering in detail RNNs, including their structure and use, what tricks they use to manage sequential data, and getting a brief glimpse at what the current SOTA looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we encountered for the first time generative modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, this lecture is a turning point. Moving forward, we will dive beyond the topics covered in *Deep Learning*, moving on to highly advanced generative modelling. We will start by learning about (variational) autoencoders and then move on to generative adversarial networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the work done in these fields deal with CNNs, but the methods are much more general. That is, even though we will work extensively with image data rest assured that the methods are useful in many fields."
