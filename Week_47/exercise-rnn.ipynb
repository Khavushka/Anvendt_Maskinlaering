    "1. Build three RNNs which take as input a sequence of length 5 with 20 features, uses a single recurrent layer with 20 nodes with a $\\texttt{ReLU}$ activation function, and then uses a $\\texttt{Dense}$ layer to perform classification of 10 classes. Use $\\texttt{SimpleRNN}$, $\\texttt{LSTM}$, and $\\texttt{GRU}$ for the recurrent layers (hence 3 total models). What is the number of parameters in each of the 3 cases?\n",
    "1. Modify your models fom **1.** using $\\texttt{Bidirectional}$ layers. Do this for (at least) the merging methods $\\texttt{concat}$ and $\\texttt{sum}$. What is the number of parameters in each of the 6 cases?\n",
    "1. Modify your models from **1.** by using a *second* recurrent layer (of the same type, so still 3 total models) with 10 nodes. What is the number of parameters in each of the 3 cases?\n",
